# Open Source Search Engine

A text based search engine. 
This search engine will crawl through README files of various Github projects on the internet and store them as documents for our retrieval system. Each document is then indexed and stored for future use. Based on the query by the user, relevant results are returned to the user based on some ranking (to be included later) of documents.
